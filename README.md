This is my submission for the Python challenge.

The first assignment is under the folder PyBank. In that I calculated:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My script prints my financial analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results to the Analysis folder.

The second assignment is under the folder PyPoll. In that I calculated: 
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

I decided to store the list of candidates as keys in a dictionary instead of a separate list to shorten the script. 
My script prints my elections analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results to the Analysis folder.
